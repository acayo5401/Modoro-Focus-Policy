  <h1>Modoro Focus & TabLock – Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p class="muted">Effective date: 2025-09-29</p>

  <p>Modoro Focus & TabLock are launcher-style Android apps that helps reduce distractions by controlling access to apps based on your chosen categories and schedules. We take a privacy-first approach and minimize data collection.</p>

  <h2>Data We Collect and Process</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Unlock code (on-device only)</strong>: Used to protect settings from unauthorized changes. Stored locally on your device using Android’s EncryptedSharedPreferences. Not transmitted to any server.</li>
    <li><strong>Parent email (optional, on-device only)</strong>: If you set a parent/recovery email, it is stored locally using EncryptedSharedPreferences. It is used only for sending a one-time recovery code email on your request. Not transmitted or shared otherwise.</li>
    <li><strong>App configuration (on-device only)</strong>: Your selected categories, schedules, and allowed apps are stored locally on your device using SharedPreferences. These are not transmitted to any server.</li>
    <li><strong>Usage access permission</strong>: If granted, the app reads foreground-app metadata to enforce Focus Protection. This information is processed in-memory/on-device for enforcement and is not transmitted or persisted beyond what is necessary to function.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>What We Do Not Collect</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>No analytics, advertising identifiers, or personal browsing/app histories are collected or sent to external servers.</li>
    <li>No cloud backend stores your data.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Email Sending</h2>
  <p>If you configure email for unlock code recovery, the app uses the SMTP credentials you provide to send the one-time recovery code. Email content (recipient address and message body) is transmitted to your configured email provider solely to deliver that email. No copy is stored or sent to us.</p>

  <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
  <p>We do not sell, rent, or share your data with third parties. Email is transmitted only to your configured email provider for the purpose of sending your requested recovery message.</p>

  <h2>Security</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Sensitive items (unlock code and optional parent email) are stored using EncryptedSharedPreferences.</li>
    <li>Non-sensitive configuration (e.g., schedules, category choices) is stored using standard SharedPreferences.</li>
    <li>No remote servers are used by the app.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Retention</h2>
  <p>All data remains on your device. It is retained until you change or delete it in the app, or uninstall the app. Uninstalling the app removes all locally stored data.</p>

  <h2>Your Choices and Controls</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>You can change or remove your unlock code and parent email in Settings.</li>
    <li>You can disable Focus Protection by revoking Usage Access or changing your default launcher.</li>
    <li>You can uninstall the app to remove all local data.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>Modoro Focus & TabLock are designed for device owners to manage their own experience. If you use the optional parent email feature, ensure you have consent and legal basis to use the email address you provide.</p>

  <h2>Policy Changes</h2>
  <p>We may update this policy from time to time. Material changes will be reflected by updating the Effective date above. Please review this page periodically.</p>
